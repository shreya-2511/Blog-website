# Blog_space
üìù Simple Blog Website (No Database)

This is a basic blog website built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **EJS**. It allows users to **create**, **view**, **edit**, and **delete** blog posts using HTTP requests like **GET**, **POST**, **PATCH**, and **DELETE**.

All posts are stored **in memory**, so they will be lost once the server restarts. This project is perfect for learning how RESTful routes and server-side rendering work.


‚ú® Features
- Create blog posts with title, content, and author name
- View all posts on the "post" page
- Edit or delete any post
- RESTful routing using Express
- Templating with EJS


üõ†Ô∏è Tech Used
- **Node.js**
- **Express**
- **EJS** (for HTML templates)
- **method-override** (to support PUT/PATCH and DELETE)
- **Nodemon** (for development)
